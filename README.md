All of my code is under the generatePassword function.

I defined four variables (passUpperCase, passLowerCase, passNum, and SpecChar) to easily define the characters allowed in the password.

I also defined "charset" to define all characters allowed. There is probably a way to not do both, but that's what I ended up doing.

I defined passLength as being between 8-128 characters and defined the prompt "Pick a number beween 8-128"

Then I defined each statement of "do you want _____" for each type of character and followed it up with the logic statements of when to execute each variable.

I then laid out the logic for the entire function. I defined i=0 and n=charset.length to let the function know that each character is allowed characters and allowed length. 

I also defined the finalPassword function and determined the math logic with that as well.

Somehow, my prompts come up when you download the page, not just when you press Generate Password, but I am unsure why that is because the event listener is defined by a click.
